# NPC-Notifier

It can be used to find an NPC you are looking for.
You will be notified in Chat when it appears and it will also draw an arrow that will take you to it.

- Command - "/add (NPC ID or name)"
- Command - "/list" (Shows the list of NPCs)
- Command - "/remove (NPC ID or name)"
- Command - "/clear" (Clears the list of NPCs)

Thanks to Cero for making the Mod Icon ^^
